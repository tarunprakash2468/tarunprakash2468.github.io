Introduction
======

Before I worked in the U.S. government, I thought its biggest weakness was moving too slowly. After a year inside, I’ve come to believe that slowness is often justified. When national security is on the line, moving too fast can be just as dangerous as moving too slow.

Over the past twelve months, I’ve been embedded in two very different corners of the Department of Defense: supporting national security space launches and helping dual-use startups bridge the gap from prototype to fielded capability. Eight months were spent fully focused on national security space launches at Space Systems Command, and the final four months I split between that work and an assignment at SpaceWERX, the innovation arm of the U.S. Space Force. On paper, they couldn’t have been more different: one was about the precision and reliability required to send billion-dollar payloads into orbit; the other was about speed, iteration, and getting new tech into the hands of operators as quickly as possible.

What tied them together and shaped my perspective, was seeing how ideas move through the system, from early concept to operational reality, and where they tend to stall along the way.

What Surprised Me Most
======

The first surprise was the depth of mission-first culture. At launch reviews, I watched career civil servants, military officers, and contractor engineers set aside organizational boundaries to focus on one question: is the mission ready? These weren’t meetings for the sake of meetings, every line of data, every open item was interrogated until the entire room was confident the mission would be a success. The discussions could be intense, but they were rooted in shared purpose.

That same sense of alignment showed up in a completely different setting at SpaceWERX. Here, program managers, contracting officers, and startup founders rallied around a warfighter’s need, working through hurdles to adapt a promising technology for operational use. The tools and tempo were different, but the intent was the same: get it right for the mission.

The Scale of Impact
======

Government work operates on a scale that’s hard to appreciate from the outside. Some of the payloads we launched will quietly operate for a decade or more, enabling secure communications, missile warning, and navigation services that billions of people rely on without ever thinking about it. Take a GPS Block III satellite: on the surface, it’s just another launch, but once on orbit it becomes part of the backbone for global navigation. Every smartphone user, every airline flight path, every military operation that relies on precise timing is touched by that spacecraft. Success isn’t measured in money or time, but in the steady impact it has on the public.

At the other end of the spectrum, I saw how an investment through a program like Strategic Funding Increase or Tactical Funding Increase could fundamentally shift a startup’s trajectory, bringing a capability from “promising prototype” to “ready for field testing” years ahead of schedule. The dollar amounts might have been small compared to the private capital raised, but the ripple effects were huge. Scale isn’t just about budget, it’s about the reach of the outcome.

The Hard Stuff
======

Of course, working inside the system also exposed the friction points.

Speed vs. certainty was a constant balancing act. Launch work was defined by rigor. Every review, test, and sign-off existed to catch problems before they could compromise a mission. It could feel slow, but the cost of a wrong decision far outweighed the cost of waiting. In the innovation world, the opposite pressure existed: founders pushed for speed, but even the fastest acquisition authorities had hard limits on how quickly contracts could be signed. Both mindsets were valid in their context, but shifting between them required rewiring how I thought about risk.

Then there was the valley of death, the infamous gap between a promising prototype and a program of record. At SpaceWERX, I saw technologies with strong demand from operators still stall because no long-term funding line existed to support them at scale. Even mature programs weren’t immune to their own form of bottleneck. Upgrades to launch systems, no matter how beneficial, still had to move through extensive certification and coordination processes before they could be adopted. Progress wasn’t just a matter of technical readiness, it was about aligning requirements, budgets, and risk tolerance across multiple decision-makers.

And underlying it all was the challenge of bridging cultures. In launch, you had aerospace veterans whose experience kept missions safe, and newer engineers eager to push faster. In innovation, you had military acquisition professionals and startup founders who spoke entirely different professional “languages.” In both cases, success depended on translation, helping each side understand not just what the other was saying, but why they were saying it.

How It Changed Me
======

Looking back, this year gave me three mindset shifts I’ll carry forward:

1. Patience as a leadership skill. In launch, I learned that discipline and process aren’t bureaucracy for its own sake - they’re the price of mission assurance. In innovation, I saw the opposite: moving too quickly before building the right relationships could kill momentum. In both cases, patience wasn’t passive; it was a form of active leadership.
2. Empathy across the bridge. At SpaceX, I thought I understood the contractor’s view of the government. Inside the government, I saw why processes and questions exist - they protect the mission. At the same time, I felt firsthand why startups find those same processes maddening. Real progress came from translating between the two worlds, not choosing sides.
3. A quieter definition of impact. Sometimes it’s a satellite quietly doing its job for a decade. Sometimes it’s a meeting that connects a founder with the right office, planting a seed that won’t bear fruit for years. Impact isn’t always loud. Often, the most meaningful contributions are the ones no one outside the mission ever sees.

Closing
======

This year wasn’t two separate jobs, it was one long crash course in how the U.S. develops, fields, and sustains capabilities for national security. From launch pads to startup labs, I saw what happens when people align around a mission, and what happens when processes, funding, and culture get in the way.

I’m leaving this chapter with a deeper appreciation for how hard this work is, how high the stakes are, and how much more we can accomplish when government, industry, and academia bring their strengths together.

It won’t be my last time working in government. But for now, it’s time to carry these lessons to the other side of the bridge.
