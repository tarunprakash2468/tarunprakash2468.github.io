Introduction
======

If you had told me a year ago that I would begin my career in the United States government, I would not have believed you. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I was surrounded by Apple, Google, and Facebook. These companies defined what innovation and impact meant to me. I knew early on that I did not want to follow the traditional path of becoming a software engineer in big tech. I wanted to build something tangible that could create real change.

In high school, engineering classes and my experience starting an edtech company confirmed that hardware was where I thrived. When I chose mechanical engineering at Purdue University, I was drawn to its reputation as the “Cradle of Astronauts.” Joining the student rocketry program gave me a front-row seat to a field that could shape humanity’s future. That passion led me to an internship at SpaceX, where I worked on technology supporting NASA missions.

As graduation approached, I was searching for something that combined mission, scale, and impact. Most of what I found felt either too technical or too disconnected from the bigger picture I wanted to be part of.

One afternoon, I was walking through the halls at Purdue when I saw the NobleReach team setting up to talk about their work at the intersection of academia, industry, and government. During their session, they spoke about the NobleReach Scholars Program, a pathway to work on some of the most pressing challenges in the public sector. They also had copies of their book, Venture Meets Mission. I picked one up, started reading that night, and couldn’t put it down. The stories and vision in those pages resonated with me in a way nothing else had. By the time I finished the book, I knew this was exactly the kind of impact I wanted to be part of. The program promised a rare chance to bridge technology, policy, and national security while learning alongside a tight-knit cohort of driven peers.

What is the Scholars Program?
======

The NobleReach Scholars Program is a one-year fellowship for early-career professionals to explore the intersection of government and emerging technologies. Scholars are embedded within federal agencies, paired with mentors, and participate in training modules in Washington, D.C. These modules include policy workshops, conversations with senior leaders, and visits to key government institutions.

I joined the program with many of the stereotypes about government work. I assumed it was slow, overly bureaucratic, and staffed by people simply waiting to retire. Those assumptions were quickly proven wrong. Through bootcamps, I met dedicated professionals who were deeply committed to serving the public. I realized that while industry is celebrated for its successes, the government is often judged only by its failures. This creates a distorted perception of how much actually gets done, and it gave me optimism about my placement with the United States Space Force.

One of the most valuable aspects of the program was the cohort. My peers came from different disciplines, but each of us was motivated by a desire to serve and innovate. During the year, especially through the chaos of the administration change, I leaned on my cohort for advice and encouragement. Priorities shifted, programs were reevaluated, and while none of us fully understood the uncertainty we were facing, we were experiencing it together. There was something grounding about having a group of people who were equally unsettled yet determined to keep moving forward

What I Did
======

Falcon Launch Enterprise
------

My primary placement was with the Falcon Launch Enterprise within the Assured Access to Space (AATS) program office. I worked as a structures responsible engineer for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) missions involving SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. I monitored the build, integration, and performance of actuators and mechanical systems to ensure mission success and reduce risk during flight.

This role gave me a rare perspective. Having previously interned at SpaceX, I now saw how the Department of Defense (DoD) collaborated with one of its largest contractors. It was fascinating to understand how technical requirements and risk assessments looked from the government side.

The stakes were high. These missions carried payloads critical to national security, where failure was not an option. There were long nights and high-pressure reviews, but working alongside the AATS team taught me how to stay calm under pressure while keeping the mission front and center.

SpaceWERX
------

My secondary placement was with SpaceWERX, the innovation arm of the United States Space Force. I worked as a program manager on the growth-stage investments team, managing Strategic Funding Increase (STRATFI) and Tactical Funding Increase (TACFI) awards. These programs bridge the “valley of death” that startups face when transitioning from prototypes to field-ready solutions.

I evaluated cutting-edge dual-use technologies, coordinated with industry and government stakeholders, and ensured that funding agreements were executed effectively. This role showed me how government investment can accelerate innovation, helping promising startups make the leap from early prototypes to operational systems. Conversations with my cohort, who were working on similar programs in other agencies, often gave me fresh ideas and perspectives to bring back to my projects.

What the Programming Added
======

The D.C.-based modules were a highlight of the year. We had direct access to leaders like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and Jen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). These conversations underscored the importance of our work and how it fit into the larger national security landscape.

Visiting the White House, Capitol Hill, NASA Goddard, and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center provided a deeper appreciation for the scale of government operations. Discussing these experiences with my cohort immediately afterward helped me connect what I was seeing in the field to broader policy goals.

Key Takeaways
======

Government work is fundamentally mission-driven. Nearly every person I met, whether civilian or military, shared the same motivation to serve the public and make a positive impact. That shared purpose is powerful.

The government also operates on a scale that few industries can match. Systems like GPS and national security satellites impact millions, even billions, of lives. However, that scale comes with challenges. Projects can move slowly due to risk mitigation and the sheer complexity of coordinating across agencies and contractors.

My time at AATS taught me that risk aversion in government is not a weakness. When you are responsible for ensuring that critical infrastructure functions without failure, caution is both necessary and justified.

Reflections
======

The NobleReach Scholars Program gave me a unique perspective on public service. It showed me that a career in government is not a one-way path but a stepping stone that can open doors to impactful opportunities in both the public and private sectors.

From AATS to SpaceWERX, I saw how the government can partner with industry to scale innovation. The line between the two worlds is far more collaborative than I once believed.

To future Scholars or graduates considering government work, I would say this: go in with patience and curiosity. It takes time to learn the culture and processes, but once you do, you will find opportunities to make a real impact. Whether you stay for a year or twenty, your contributions will matter.
